**The AIM of the Courses Dataset:**
Analyze patterns in course enrollments and learner engagement, generate insights that help educators, platforms, and decision-makers improve course design, marketing strategies, and learner outcomes.
For example, a marketing team can understand which categories (e.g., Business, Tech) are bringing in the most students or revenue.

Stakeholders: 
1. Sales Team	: Focus efforts on Hot leads, save time by avoiding low-quality leads
2. Marketing Team	: Learn which campaigns and channels bring the best leads
3. Executives	: Get a clear overview of performance and lead quality via the Power BI dashboard

**📁 Files Included in This Project**
data_analysis_leadscoring.py: Full Python code (Google Colab) for cleaning the data, analyzing trends, building ML models, and scoring leads.

lead_scoring_output_GoogleColab.csv: Final output file that includes lead score and category for each lead.

Leads Dashboard.pbix: Power BI dashboard showing lead behavior, source analysis, score categories, and performance summaries.

Leadscoring.csv & Lead Dictionary: A original version of the dataset.

**🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used**
Python: For data processing, visualization, and model building

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost

Google Colab: Python execution environment

Power BI: For stakeholder-facing visual dashboards

CSV files: For importing and exporting lead data

**🔍 Key Business Insights**
Lead source, time on website, and lead quality scores were major indicators of conversion.

ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost were used and evaluated.

A Lead Score was created using model predictions and used to classify leads into:

a) Hot

b) Warm

c) Cold

Power BI was used to visualize the findings and allow business users to interact with the data easily.

**🧠 Python Script Breakdown: data_analysis_leadscoring.py**
This Python file includes a complete lead scoring pipeline:

 1. Data Preprocessing

    Loaded and cleaned 9240 rows of raw lead data

    Handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns

    Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding

 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Analyzed key features: Lead Source, Country, Total Visits, Page Views

    Plotted visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn

    Identified features highly correlated with conversion

 3. Feature Engineering

    Created new columns like:

    lead_score (based on predicted probability)

    lead_category: Hot (score > 0.7), Warm (0.4–0.7), Cold (< 0.4)

 4. Model Building & Evaluation

    Applied and compared 4 models:-

    >Logistic Regression

    >Decision Tree

    >Random Forest

    >XGBoost

    Used train/test split (70/30) and metrics like:

    >Accuracy: Up to 85% with XGBoost

    >Precision/Recall/F1 scores to evaluate classification

    >Confusion matrix and ROC-AUC for deeper analysis

 5. Lead Scoring Output

    Saved final leads with predicted scores and category to CSV

    Ready to plug into CRM or dashboard tools

**📊 Power BI Dashboard Summary: Leads Dashboard.pbix**
The dashboard provides real-time insights for non-technical stakeholders:

Key Visuals:-

Total Leads: 9,244

Conversion Rate: ~34.8%

**Lead Categories:**

a)Hot Leads: 2,180

b)Warm Leads: 3,094

c)Cold Leads: 3,970

The dashboard sections and key findings:

1️⃣ Engagement Level (Hot, Warm, Cold)
This is your lead scoring outcome shown visually.

Hot Leads = High chance to convert (score ≥ 70)

Warm Leads = Medium chance to convert (score 40–70)

Cold Leads = Low chance (score < 40)

🔍 Insight:

A significant % of leads are "Cold", but around 15–20% are "Hot", meaning the company should focus outreach on those first.

2️⃣ Lead Source Analysis
This shows where the leads came from: Google Ads, Facebook, Referral, etc.

🔍 Insight:

Some lead sources (like Google or Direct Traffic) have a much higher conversion rate.

Others (like Facebook) may bring more traffic but fewer conversions.

✅ Action for stakeholders:

Shift more marketing budget to high-performing channels.

3️⃣ Country-Wise Performance
Shows how leads perform by country or region.

🔍 Insight:

Most converting leads are from India. Other countries like the US or UK may need localized content or different strategies.

✅ Action:

Consider tailoring campaigns by geography.

4️⃣ Lead Funnel (Stage Drop-off)
Visual representation of how many leads progress from first contact to conversion.

🔍 Insight:

Large drop-offs after the “Initial Contact” stage → Possible communication or onboarding issue.

✅ Action:

Focus on improving follow-up process (e.g., quicker emails or demo calls).

5️⃣ Top Specializations / Interests
Visuals show which courses or specializations users are interested in.

🔍 Insight:

Specializations like Finance, Marketing, and Operations are more popular → aligns with student demand.

✅ Action:

Promote these programs more or offer bundled discounts.

6️⃣ Engagement Score Breakdown
Based on:

Total Website Visits

Time Spent on Site

Pages Viewed

🔍 Insight:

Leads with high engagement are far more likely to convert.

✅ Action:

Create automated alerts to notify sales team when engagement score > threshold.



**💼 Business Impact**
Sales teams can now prioritize better, focusing on leads that are more likely to convert.

Marketing teams can see which lead sources perform best and refine their campaigns.

Executives can track performance using a clean, visual dashboard that’s easy to use and understand.
